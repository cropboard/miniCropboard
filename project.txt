MiniCropBoard 

This project aims at providing basic functionality for the cropboard project
Its main goal as from what i think is to collect some data from farmers that can be used in the main project.
This way, i will have a better view of what farmers want, the issues they usually face and be able 
to create a small mind model of what they encounter and also what the main issue (or atleast a rough sketch of what the main issue is)
in their agricultural and or farming activity.

What will this app do

It will basically collect the following data

- Fertilizer usage (applied)
- Quantity of seeds input (in a physical quantity like tonnes)
- We will, in the background, track the location of the farmer
- We will provide weather data (daily and future forecasts)
- Water usage
- Expenditures in inputs
- The amount got back in the month
- We calculate the revenue of the farmer depending on the initial expenditures that month
- We automatically calculate the farmer's crop yield and productivity for them
- When a farmer enters the fertilizer type he is using for a month, we save it so he can always have an option to select it 
in the future
- We get the farmer's sales if possible
- We collect the location of the farm(s) of the farmer

We keep track of the weather conditions to continue tailoring what is going on.

We help the farmer in having an analytical overview of what is going on in his farm by presenting graphs and charts.

In the background, we make use of the farmer's IP address to be able to know his location but still we let him enter
this information at registration.

On every login or everytime the farmer opens the app, we get his geological coordinates.

We build a machine learning model to be able to identify sick and healthy plants and deploy it in the app to help the farmers.
We request the farmers to upload more pictures of their plants and data they get while we collect it to build a model.
Or when farmers try to identify their sick or healthy plants, we take the picture they input, clean it and use it
to improve on the model

This is not going to be easy to build for sure but it is all i got for now. Also the app has to be entirely free to use 
so that farmers can easily have access to it and use it without worrying about paying a fee.

# If a product is free, you are the product

That is right, here the farmer will provide be the data we will be collecting. But it is for the good right ?!
We will let the farmers who register know that anyways. 
Running the 'small' app will let us continually get better at it.


## Okay weather data is really complicated sometimes... What data do we want exactly ?

temperature: Int
day: TimeStamp
